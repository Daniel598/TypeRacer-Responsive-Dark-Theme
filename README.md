## ðŸŽ¨ What is this theme?
This is a dark theme for the new TypeRacer 2019 Responsive theme. Right now some of the UI elements feel too big in my opinion and personally on a site that I play a lot, I feel that typing with lots of bright colors makes me lose focus and strains my eyes so I created this while making it look good! (Replaced some low res images with my own little things).
